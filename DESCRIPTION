Package: ssh.utils
Title: Local and remote system commands with output and error capture.
Version: 1.0
Author: Sergei Izrailev
Maintainer: Sergei Izrailev <sizrailev@collective.com>
Description: This package provides utility functions for system command
    execution, both locally and remotely using ssh/scp. The command
    output is captured and provided to the caller. This functionality is
    intended to streamline calling shell commands from R, retrieving and
    using their output, while instrumenting the calls with appropriate
    error handling. NOTE: this first version is limited to unix with local
    and remote systems running bash as the default shell.
